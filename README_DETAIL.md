AVIF Image Compression Project

Welcome to the AVIF Image Compression Project! This repository aims to help non-programmers, semi-programmers, and beginners understand the importance of image compression and learn about the advanced AVIF image format. By using AVIF, we can drastically reduce image file sizes while maintaining high quality, all while minimizing resource usage on platforms like GitHub.

Why AVIF?

AVIF (AV1 Image File Format) is a modern image format that provides significant advantages over traditional formats like JPEG and PNG. Here’s why it’s a great choice:

High Compression: AVIF allows for much smaller file sizes than older formats without sacrificing image quality.

Advanced Algorithm: Based on the AV1 video codec, AVIF uses cutting-edge technology to achieve superior compression efficiency.

Better Performance: Smaller file sizes mean faster loading times and reduced bandwidth usage, making it ideal for web projects.

Lower GitHub Resource Usage: Since the files are smaller, this reduces storage requirements and optimizes resource usage on GitHub.

The Goal of This Project

The main objective of this project is to introduce non-programmers and semi-programmers to the concept of image compression and efficient storage formats. By contributing images to this repository, you will:

Learn how to compress images to a modern format (AVIF).

Understand how image compression impacts storage and performance.

Gain hands-on experience with GitHub workflows without needing programming skills.

How It Works

Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine.

Convert your images to the AVIF format (using any converter or online tool).

Compress the image to ensure it is optimized for size (files should be smaller than 1MB).

Commit and push the AVIF image back to the repository.

Since Pull Requests (PRs) are not accepted, all images will be reviewed and added manually by repository maintainers to ensure quality.

This project is an educational tool, so it’s a great way to practice using GitHub, even if you’re not a developer!

Why No Pull Requests (PRs)?

While PRs are commonly used in many GitHub repositories, in this project, we’re not allowing them for the following reasons:

Simplicity: The goal is to keep things simple and accessible for non-developers. This project is focused on image manipulation and compression rather than code review.

Resource Efficiency: Handling direct file uploads without the complexity of PRs reduces unnecessary GitHub operations and helps keep the repository more efficient.

Controlled Contributions: All images will be checked for quality before being added, ensuring that only properly compressed and optimized images are included in the repository.

Benefits of Participating

Learn GitHub Workflows: Even without coding skills, you will learn about basic GitHub workflows like forking, cloning, committing, and pushing changes.

Contribute to a Modern Web Standard: You’ll be contributing to a repository that uses the latest image technology (AVIF), which helps reduce storage and bandwidth costs.

Collaborate and Educate: This project is a community effort to promote the use of modern compression techniques. By participating, you’re helping to make the internet faster and more efficient.

How to Get Started

Fork this repository to your GitHub account.

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

Convert your images to AVIF format using tools like:

Squoosh

AVIF.io

ImageMagick

Compress images to make sure they are under 1MB.

Push your AVIF images to your forked repository.

That’s it! You’re now contributing to this project and learning GitHub in the process.
